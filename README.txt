Before running dict.py please do 2 things:
1) run 'sortwords.py words.txt' -> use 'output.txt' when you run dict.py
2) read the comment block at the top of dict.py

words.txt is a combined dictionary compiled from scowl, jargon, and
standard unix dictionaries and contains over 750,000 words. This
number, however, can change drastically from system to system based on
the results of sortwords.

Also, please realize that these scripts were written for performance,
not speed or efficiency.
